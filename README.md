# PDF-Analyzer

A Python-based tool that allows users to ask questions and retrieve answers directly from the content of a PDF document using machine learning algorithms. The tool leverages the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm and TF-IDF vectorization to find the most relevant section of the PDF that answers the user's query.

Features
PDF Text Extraction: Extracts text from PDF files while preserving the format.
Text Segmentation: Automatically segments the text into meaningful sections.
Machine Learning Model: Uses k-NN and TF-IDF to identify the most relevant section of the PDF in response to a user's question.
Interactive Query Interface: Allows users to input questions and get instant answers from the PDF content.
